# Password Manager Project
Description:  
This is a project I created to manage your passwords using tkinter. You can enter the new website and account, let it generate a secure password for you, and store these info into a json file called 'my_passwords.json' in the same base directory. Then you can search for an entry by enter the website name in the search bar.
## Getting Started
To start the project, build a venv on top of 'requirements.txt', and run the 'main.py'.
